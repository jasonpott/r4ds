# C4TS and BH R for Data science co-learning club

This repo will include the materials that I use to co-ordinate settions for the co-learning R-club

The book we are using to guide our learning is R for Data Science (R4DS).  
R4DS can be found online for free at https://r4ds.had.co.nz or physical copies can be bought from most online book shops.

The sessions are organised in folders within this repository and will include any materials we use or link to in the sessions.

## Session Notes

Sessions will follow a plan outlined in an rmarkdown file which will then be updated to include the notes and tips from the session.
