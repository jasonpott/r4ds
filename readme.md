# C4TS and BH R for Data science co-learning club

This repo will include the materials that I use to co-ordinate settions for the co-learning club

The book we are using is R for Data Science
It can be found online for free at https://r4ds.had.co.nz
or physical copies can be bought from most online book shops.

The sessions are organised in folders and will include any materials we use or link to in the sessions.
